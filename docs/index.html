            <h2>Engine Description</h2>
            <p>The Real Engine 5 is a video game engine developed as a university project for the third-year subject of Video Game Engines. In this subject we have had to develop an engine implementing (or trying) all the functionalities that were asked of us. There have been three deliveries, each of which has demanded certain implementations, the most important of all being the last, in which each class group was assigned a high-level system in which to specialize their engine, ours being 3D physics. Below we leave as a list all the features that our engine has, separated by the delivery in which they were ordered. Below are some visual examples of the capabilities and uses of the engine and finally all the libraries that we have used.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="features">
            <h2>Basic Features</h2>
            <p>- Drag and drop game objects and textures in the Hierarchy.</p>
            <p>- Create game objects with Game Objects Menu</p>
            <p>- Delete game objects by pressing Delete at Inspector</p>
            <p>- Delete selected game object at Hierarchy by pressing Delete.</p>
            <p>- Move Game Ojects in Hierarchy by drag and drop them.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="controls">
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                - While Right clicking:
                <ul>
                    <li> - WASD: move forward, left, backward and right</li>
                    <li> - QE: move up and down</li>
                    <li> - Look around</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>- F: look at target</li>
            <li>
                - Hold Alt:
                <ul>
                    <li> - Mouse Hold Left to orbit the game object selected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>- Mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out.</li>
            <li>- Holding SHIFT duplicates movement speed.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <section id="second-assignment-features">
            <h3>2nd Assignment Features</h3>
            <h4>Misc.</h4>
            <p>- The ‘Street Environment’ scene is automatically loaded at the start.</p>

            <h4>Game Objects</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - The user is able to use the inspector to modify a GameObject:
                    <ul>
                        <li>         - Hierarchy: delete, reparent, create empty and create children</li>
                        <li>         - Transform: translate, rotate and scale Game Objects.</li>
                        <li>         - Mesh: select or drop any imported mesh</li>
                        <li>         - Texture: select or drop any imported texture</li>
                        <li>         - Camera is a component with settings that can be modified.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>- GameObjects can be picked from the world using the mouse.</p>
            <p>- All meshes use a bounding volume (AABB) and can be discarded using Frustum Culling. This process is visualized in the editor.</p>

            <h4>Scenes</h4>
            <p>- The user can Start / Pause / Stop the simulation and recover its original state.</p>
            <p>- The editor has 2 windows one with the scene(editor view) and another captured from a gameobject with a camera component(main game camera), each one has its own framebuffer and the user can visualize both at the same time.</p>

            <h4>Resource Management</h4>
            <p>- The user can drop/import new files. Hierarchy window reacts properly.</p>
            <p>- Asset files can be deleted through the Hierarchy window.</p>
